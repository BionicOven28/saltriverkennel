# Salt River Kennel Website

Not only is this repository a website to display my kennel information, I also use it as an example to potential clients who would like to commission
me to build their kennel website. 

## Libraries & Elements Used

To build this website I used ReactJS, React-Bootstrap, Elemental UI, and Material UI.
All of the dogs pictured on the website are property of my kennel, were used in my breeding program, or were trained by my program.

## Commission Information
